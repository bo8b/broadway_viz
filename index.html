<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>When we refer to "Broadway Theatre," that name refers to a number of theatres located in central midtown Manhattan, north of Greenwich Village and south of Central Park.  Broadway (the road) actually runs from Bowling Green in southern Manhattan all the way through that burough, through the Bronx, and continuing to run for several miles through several towns outside of New York City.  There are currently 41 official Broadway Theatres, although this number changes frequently.  Generally, to be classified as a Broadway house, the theatre will be able to seat over 500 people (although there have been exceptions to this).  It has more to do with what sort of contract the current production has.</p>
<p>There is a rich history of Broadway shows, stretching all the way back to the 1750s at the Theatre on Nassau Street, which produced Shakespeare plays, ballad operas, and ballad-farces.</p>
<p>In this narrative visualization, we will examine the history of Broadway shows as far back as 1901, we will look at attendance trends over the past 25 years, and then we will delve more thoroughly into the financial gross revenues for recent productions.</p>
